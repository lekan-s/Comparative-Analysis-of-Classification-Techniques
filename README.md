# Comparative-Analysis-of-Classification-Techniques
This project looks at the use of classification approaches to predict contraceptive decisions among married women in Indonesia. The dataset used in this study is made up of demographic and socioeconomic information of 1473 married women obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice. The goal is to divide the contraceptive options into three categories: "no use," "short term use," and "long term use." Three classification algorithms, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), naive Bayes, and decision trees, were used and evaluated for prediction accuracy.
The findings show that the decision tree exceeds KNN and na√Øve Bayes in properly predicting contraceptive decisions. When compared to the other two approaches, decision trees outperform them in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. The findings indicate that decision tree classification might be a useful tool for healthcare practitioners and policymakers in understanding married women's contraception choices and developing focused interventions to enhance reproductive health outcomes.
